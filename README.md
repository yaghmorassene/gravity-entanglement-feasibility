# Gravity-Mediated Entanglement Feasibility (MATLAB Code)

MATLAB simulations and figures accompanying the paper *"Gravity-mediated entanglement feasibility and calibration"*.  
Includes end-to-end scripts for visibility fits, dephasing budgets, scaling-law checks, and CHSH feasibility.

This repository contains the MATLAB simulations and figures accompanying the work on *gravity-mediated entanglement feasibility and calibration*.

## Includes:
- end-to-end visibility fits  
- dephasing budget calculations  
- PSD-based law checks  
- CHSH feasibility bounds  
- dashboard plotting tools  
- scripts for stress-testing parameters and reproducing the figures of the paper  

The codebase is modular and supports fully automated reproduction of all outputs.
